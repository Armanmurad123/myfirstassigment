    <p>Health has a variety of definitions, which have been used for different purposes over time. Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, <br>
        such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep,[1] and by reducing or avoiding<br> unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress.
         Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices,<br> such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes,
          such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it <br>easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services.
         Still, other factors are beyond both individual<br> and group choices, such as genetic disorders.</p>
